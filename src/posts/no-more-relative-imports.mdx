Something I see consistently in React is how painful relative imports are to a developers workflow.  They really get in the way of a good architecture because:

- We resist creating smaller components to avoid writing those annoying imports again.
- We avoid moving our components around since doing so also means we need to adjust all of the imports.

The good news is, this can be fixed with a little magic from `webpack`.  More specifically, `webpack.resolve.alias`.  Here's [a link to their documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) if you want a deeper understanding.

#### Let's dive right in with an example.

Here's a pretend file deep in your codebase.

``` jsx
// from src/components/forms/fields/datetime/index.js
import utils from '../../../../../utils/datetime-format'
```

That's not very fun, and I usually get the path wrong a time or two before I figure it out.  Wouldn't it be great if I didn't have to remember how many folders to include in my path?  What if I could _start_ at `utils` and go _forward_ instead of starting at my file and going _backward_?

Well, you can!  By adding this little snippet to your webpack config.  (Not sure what that is?  You can [learn more about it here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#using-a-configuration))

You may need to modify this a bit since every project is different.

``` jsx
resolve: {
  alias: {
    utils: path.resolve('./src/utils'),
  },
}
```

Once you have the resolve alias in place, you'll be able to do this instead!

``` jsx
// from src/components/forms/fields/datetime/index.js
import utils from 'utils/datetime-format'
```

From now on, you'll _never_ have to keep track of how many folders deep you are in your project.  You'll also be able to move your component around _anywhere_ in your application's `src` folder without needing to alter the imports.

Enjoy!
