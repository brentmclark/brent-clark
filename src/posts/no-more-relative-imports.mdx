I've helped a lot of people with their project architecture over the years and one that I see consistently in React 
is how painful relative imports are to a developers workflow.  They really get in the way of a good architecture by 
incentivizing complacency.  Without these aliases we tend to form two fairly bad habits:

1. We resist creating more granular components because it means writing those anoying imports again.
2. We resist moving our components around since doing so also means we need to adjust all of the imports.
