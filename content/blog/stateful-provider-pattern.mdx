In my quest to find alternatives to `redux` – and other general-purpose state management libraries in `react` – I've been tinkering with 
react's Context API.  When combined with the `useState` or `useReducer` it produces some powerful effects that can serve as a direct 
replacement for `redux` if your needs aren't too complex.

One thing I've struggled with when using this pattern is that it doesn't have a name.  I found myself trying to describe it as "React 
context mixed with state" which still doesn't do justice to this pattern.  So, I gave it a name!  I call it the `Stateful Provider 
Pattern` and you should too!

As mentioned, the `Stateful Provider Pattern` is a combination of react's Context API and either the state or reducer hooks. To keep this
article as focused as possible I'm only going to cover the `useState` hook. Let's break down these two elements to see how they can 
be used together to create something powerful.

## The Context API

The most recent iteration of the [Context API]([https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)) (introduced
in 16.3) is one of those things that can be very confusing if you're new to the concept.  It helps me to think of it as a variant of the
[Observer Pattern](h[ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)) popularized by the
classic [Gang of Four]([https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GangOfFour.html](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GangOfFour.html)) book.  Don't 
feel like you need to know those things before mastering the `Stateful Provider Pattern` though.  The links are purely for reference.
Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with the Observer Pattern, you can think about the Context API like this:  

A single source of truth (called a `Provider`) is in charge of storing one or more values.  Multiple components that want to know about these
values connect to the provider (with the `useContext` hook) so they can access its values. These components are considered *consumers* of 
the `Provider`.

When you create a new context (with the `createContext` method) you get back two components.  A `Provider` and a `Consumer`.  Under the
hood, react keeps track of their relationship so they can always find each other.  

#### Provider
The `Provider` accepts a prop called `value` and also accepts `children`.  `value` can be anything from a boolean to a highly-complex object.
`children` is just like `children` anywhere else in `react` with one very important difference.  Any `Consumer` components found among the 
`children` of a `Provider` will receive the _closest_ `Provider` when accessing its context.  This is not normally something you need to 
worry about, but can be a factor on occasion.

#### Consumer
The `Consumer` exists solely to access the value from its `Provider`.  In fact, most of the time you won't even see the word `Consumer` in
when using the Context API because react provides you with the `useContext` hook to do the heavy lifting for you.  Going forward, I will use
the term `useContext` instead of `Consumer` since you'll be using that hook to access the provider instead of working with the `Consumer`
component directly.

#### Context API as Dependency Injection
Another thing that has helped me wrap my head around the Context API is to think of it as a dependency injection mechanism.  A `value` (the
dependency) is set on the `Provider` and it is _injected_ into the consumers by the `useContext` hook.  This can be very useful when you 
have a value that is not going to change.  Great examples of this are the `<ThemeProvider>` from [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#themeprovider)
or if your app keeps track of user settings which are kept somewhere that can't easily be imported (e.g. `localStorage`).


## The `useState` Hook

In it's simplest form the `useState` hook holds a single value and provides a method for overwriting this value.  In examples, you'll see 
these represented as a [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) with 2 elements called `state` and `setState` where `state` is our value
and `setState` is the function to overwrite the `state`.  You do _not_ need to call them `state` and `setState`.  You can call them anything
you want; it's recommended to make sure they follow the `{thing}` and `set{thing}` pattern, though.  This helps future readers of your code
understand your intent.

The value stored in `state` can be anything from a boolean to a highly-complex object.  Does that sound familiar?  It should, because that's
the exact description of the `value` prop for a `Provider`.  Coincidence?  I think not!


## Stateful Provider Pattern

Now that we know a bit more about the Context API and the `useState` hook, it's time to talk about how we weave them together into a `Stateful
Provider`.  Thinking back to the section about dependency injection, what if the dependency isn't static?  What if it needs to change over time?
The Context API doesn't offer anything to solve this problem directly.  You can, of course, use some form of state management _above_ the
`Provider` to allow the `value` to be changed.  Let's explore that a bit with a working example.  For our purposes, we are focusing on `App.js`
in the examples below, but I encourage you to click through to see the entire application.

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/react-context-demo-7jjge?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style={{width:'100%', height:'500px', border:0, borderRadius: '4px', overflow:'hidden'}}
     title="React Context Demo"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

In this demo, we use the Context API to hep other components determine if a user is authenticated.  But it's a bit messy because the code to 
determine if the user is authenticated is kept separate from the code to update the users authentication status.  This means we have to important
code from multiple places in the app which raises the complexity of our code needlessly.  Wouldn't it be great if we could have the 
authentication status _and_ the updater function come from the same spot?  Well, we can.  That's one of the many possibilities when using a
`Stateful Provider`.  Let's rearrange the previous example into a `Stateful Provider` to see how much easier it is to accomplish the same effect.

style={{width:'100%', height:'500px', border:0, borderRadius: '4px', overflow:'hidden'}}
     title="stateful-provider-demo"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

Pay extra attention to the differences in `App.js` between these two examples.  The second example that uses a `Stateful Provider` has moved all of the
logic for managing the state of the user into a single file.  This change produces a much cleaner outcome that is easier to read.  It also makes future
changes to this behavior much simpler since you'll only need to make changes in a single file.

## Conclusion

In this article you learned about the `Stateful Provider Pattern` and how it can be used to create a `Stateful Provider` in react by combining
the `Context API` with the `useState` hook.  You saw a demo of how to accomplish the same thing _without_ a `Stateful Provider` and why using
a `Stateful Provider` is an improvement.
