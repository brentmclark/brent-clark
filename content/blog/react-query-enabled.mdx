If you're new to [`react-query`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) you should definitely [head there first](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) to learn more. Then come back!

This short article focuses on one very specific configuration option to the `useQuery` hook called `enabled`. This option can be set to anything that resolves to a boolean, and, when false, will prevent the query from firing. This is especially useful when you need to handle dependent (waterfall) queries or wait for user input.

### Breaking Down the Code

Again, this is not an article about how to use `react-query`, so we aren't going to cover the first two arguments to the `useQuery` hook. This article is about the 3rd, optional argument to `useQuery`; the `options` argument. Specificially the `enabled` option.

```javascript
const options = { enabled: isEnabled }
const query = useQuery(key, fetchFunction, options)
```

There's not much to it, really, and that's what's so amazing about the `enabled` option. In the example above, `useQuery` will not call `fetchFunction` unless `isEnabled` resolves to `true`.

This allows you to write the `useQuery` hook _as if_ it were always going to call `fetchFunction` instead of writing additional code to prevent `useQuery` from running at all. So, the next time you need to prevent `useQuery` from running until a condition is met, give the `enabled` option a try.
